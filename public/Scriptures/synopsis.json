           "Book": "Genesis",
           "summary": "The word \"genesis\" signifies \"generation\" or \"origin\" and comes from the Greek translation of Genesis 2:4. It is an appropriate title for the first book of the Bible, which contains the record of the origin of the universe, the human race, family life, nations, sin redemption, etc. The first 11 chapters, which deal with primeval or pre-Patriarchal times, present the antecedents of Hebrew history from Adam to Abraham. The remaining chapters (12 - 50) are concerned with God’s dealings with the Patriarchs Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and Jacob’s son Joseph, all \"fathers\" of the people whom God has chosen to carry out His plan for the redemption of mankind. The book closes with these \"Chosen People\" in Egypt."
